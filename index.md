### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 is one of my favorites because it is my first time learning the instructions of blackjack. My lab partners and I got confused during this process and after spending some time on this part, we finally did it! We are proud of ourselves after we were done. I had fun working in groups and learned more about if and else-if statements.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 is one of my favorites because I love animations and always wonder how they are written. In this lab, we use built-in functions to read a file and print out everything in the file to form the images and animations. It was so cool when I and my lab partner saw the images moving and changing.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 is one of my favorite because I am using spelling check everyday. Spell checking is now built into every documentation application, software, and site. Since I make spelling mistakes all the time, I thought a spell checker would be very useful. I'm excited to write a program that detects spelling mistakes in a file and prints out the correct spelling.
